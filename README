ASLA is an open source license recognition and analyzator tool.

If you wish to do license and dependency check for your package you should first:
	1. Compile modified versions of gnu linker (ld) and archive tool (ar). Modified 
versions are distributed as a separate package.
	2. Set the PATH -environment variable to the location of modified versions of ar and ld. 
( export PATH=/location_of_the_modified_ar_and_ld:$PATH )
	3. Set the environment variable DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT: export DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT=objects.dep
	4. Configure and make the software packages that you wish to analyze.
	5. Run license analysis for the source tree: Analyze -> Analyze package (select
the top folder of the source package)


You can also make a simple license recognition for your package:
Just extract the source package that you wish to check. Then run license recognition
from the UI: Analyze -> Analyze only licenses of a package
This does not require the compilation.

Tool functionality and used techniques are described in:
